title: "Downlaoding Files with R"

This is a small script to download files form the [here][1] with R and transform to csv.

First we are going to load a couple of packages to use them later on. 

```{r, setup}
library("readstata13")
library("tools")
```

Now we donwload the file

```{r file download}
download.file(url = "https://md-datasets-cache-zipfiles-prod.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/svg2tscvzs-1.zip", destfile = "data.zip")
```

We decompress it on the folder `data`. 

```{r decompress}
unzip("data.zip", exdir = "data")
```

And we finally transform it to csv files with a function and `lapply`. 

```{r transform, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
to_csv <- function(x){
  if (file_ext(x) == "dta") {
    dta <- read.dta13(file = x)
  write.csv(dta, file = paste0("data/", file_path_sans_ext(basename(x)),".csv"), )
  }
}

lapply(dir("data", full.names = T), to_csv)
```
